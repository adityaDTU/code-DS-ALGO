"""
Given an integer n, return whether n = k * k for some integer k.
This should be done without using built-in square root function.
"""
"""
Constraints:
0 â‰¤ n < 2 ** 31
"""
"""
Example-1:

Input:

n = 25

Output:

True

Explanation:

25 = 5 * 5


"""
"""
Approach:
Use binary search to continuously divide the number until the square of the number becomes equal to number itself.
